# Plan 01 Summary: Verify Phase 31 + Fix Ask-Me-More Bug

## What Was Built

### New Files
- `.planning/phases/31-simple-mode-ui-shell/31-VERIFICATION.md` -- Phase 31 verification report with code-level evidence for all 4 success criteria and 3 requirement IDs (DASH-01, DASH-02, DASH-03). Status: human_needed (automated checks pass, visual verification required).

### Modified Files
- `packages/dashboard/src/components/simple-mode/discussion/discussion-view.tsx` -- Fixed `useMockQuestions` "Ask me more" dead-end bug. Replaced single `hasSentRef` with `hasSentBatch1Ref`/`hasSentBatch2Ref` dual guards. Added `MOCK_QUESTIONS_BATCH_2` constant with 2 new questions (Deployment, Team Size). "Ask me more" now dispatches batch 2 instead of entering permanent skeleton loading state. Both refs reset on `phase === "idle"` for full discussion reset.

## Key Decisions
- Used `human_needed` status for 31-VERIFICATION.md since all automated checks pass but visual/interactive behaviors need browser verification
- Placed `MOCK_QUESTIONS_BATCH_2` before `MOCK_QUESTIONS` in file to keep the declaration order consistent with usage (batch 2 is referenced after batch 1)
- Kept the loading guard structure intact (dual refs instead of no guard) to prevent spurious mock dispatches on ANSWER_ACCEPTED queue-drain transitions

## Self-Check: PASSED
- [x] 31-VERIFICATION.md exists with DASH-01, DASH-02, DASH-03 evidence
- [x] `useMockQuestions` uses `hasSentBatch1Ref`/`hasSentBatch2Ref` dual guards
- [x] `MOCK_QUESTIONS_BATCH_2` defined with 2 new questions
- [x] No new TypeScript errors introduced
- [x] Both automated verify checks PASS

## Commits

2. `fix(32.1-01): fix useMockQuestions "Ask me more" dead-end bug`
