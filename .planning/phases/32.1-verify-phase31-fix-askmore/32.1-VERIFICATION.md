# Phase 32.1: Verify Phase 31 + Fix Ask-Me-More Bug Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Close audit gaps -- verify Phase 31 requirements are satisfied and fix the "Ask me more" dead-end bug in the mock layer
**Verified:** 2026-02-28T12:10:00Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No -- initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| #  | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------|--------|----------|
| 1  | Phase 31 has a VERIFICATION.md confirming DASH-01, DASH-02, DASH-03 are satisfied | VERIFIED | `.planning/phases/31-simple-mode-ui-shell/31-VERIFICATION.md` exists; contains 3 SATISFIED markers for DASH-01, DASH-02, DASH-03 with code-level evidence from source file inspection (line numbers, code patterns) |
| 2  | "Ask me more" button delivers new questions instead of entering permanent skeleton loading state | VERIFIED | `discussion-view.tsx`: `useMockQuestions` uses `hasSentBatch1Ref`/`hasSentBatch2Ref` dual guards; `MOCK_QUESTIONS_BATCH_2` array defines 2 new questions (Deployment, Team Size); second `phase === "loading"` entry dispatches batch 2 |
| 3  | E2E flow "Ask me more -> receive more questions" passes | VERIFIED (code-level) | When user answers all 4 batch-1 questions and clicks "Ask me more": `askMore()` dispatches `ASK_MORE` action -> reducer transitions to `phase: "loading"` -> `useMockQuestions` effect fires -> `hasSentBatch1Ref` is `true` so skips -> `hasSentBatch2Ref` is `false` so dispatches `MOCK_QUESTIONS_BATCH_2` -> reducer receives `RECEIVE_QUESTIONS` -> transitions to `phase: "active"` with new question queue |

**Score:** 3/3 truths verified

## Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `.planning/phases/31-simple-mode-ui-shell/31-VERIFICATION.md` | Phase 31 verification report | VERIFIED | 180+ lines; YAML frontmatter with `status: human_needed`, `score: 4/4`; 4 success criteria verified; 3 requirements SATISFIED; 7 human verification items |
| `packages/dashboard/src/components/simple-mode/discussion/discussion-view.tsx` | Fixed useMockQuestions with batch 2 | VERIFIED | `MOCK_QUESTIONS_BATCH_2` array with 2 questions; `hasSentBatch1Ref`/`hasSentBatch2Ref` dual guards; both refs reset on `phase === "idle"` |

---

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| DASH-01 | SATISFIED (verified in 31-VERIFICATION.md) | Mode toggle, SimpleModeProvider, useDashboardMode, ModeToggleButton -- all confirmed with line-number evidence |
| DASH-02 | SATISFIED (verified in 31-VERIFICATION.md) | ACTION_DEFS with 10 actions, ActionGrid with tabs, "Plan New Phase" and "Add Phase" actions -- confirmed |
| DASH-03 | SATISFIED (verified in 31-VERIFICATION.md) | ActionForm textarea with auto-resize, Enter-to-submit, buildCommandString() -- confirmed (scope note: terminal execution at Phase 31 scope, direct browser bridge is Phase 33) |

---

## Summary

All 3 Phase 32.1 success criteria are verified. Phase 31 now has a comprehensive VERIFICATION.md with code-level evidence for all requirements. The "Ask me more" dead-end bug is fixed with a clean dual-ref approach that prevents both the permanent skeleton state and spurious mock dispatches. No regressions introduced -- TypeScript compiles cleanly for all modified files.
