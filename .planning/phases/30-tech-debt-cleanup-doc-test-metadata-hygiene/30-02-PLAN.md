<objective>
Update three VERIFICATION.md files whose statuses are stale — gaps/human-needs have been resolved in the working tree but the verification documents were never updated.

Purpose: Close 3 of 9 actionable tech debt items from the v2.0 milestone audit — the stale VERIFICATION.md statuses for phases 27, 28, and 29.
Output: Updated VERIFICATION.md files with corrected status and resolution notes

Update the Phase 27 VERIFICATION.md:

1. In frontmatter:
   - Change `status: human_needed` to `status: passed`
   - Change `score: 3/4 must-haves verified` to `score: 4/4 must-haves verified`
   - Add `resolved_by: "Phase 30 (tech debt closure — E2E suite confirmed green in CI)"` field

2. In the Observable Truths table (Truth #4):
   - Change `? UNCERTAIN` to `✓ VERIFIED`
   - Update evidence to: `E2E suite confirmed green in CI pipeline (publish.yml e2e job passes on main branch)`

3. Update the body status line from `**Status:** human_needed` to `**Status:** passed`

4. In the Gaps Summary section, add a resolution note:
   > **Resolved (Phase 30):** E2E suite runs and passes in CI. The human_needed flag was for manual confirmation which CI now provides automatically.

The rationale: Phase 27 added the e2e CI job. The job runs and passes on pushes to main, which satisfies the "E2E tests pass" truth that required human verification. CI green = tests pass.

**Phase 28 VERIFICATION.md:**
1. In frontmatter:
   - Change `status: gaps_found` to `status: passed`
   - Change `score: 5/6 must-haves verified` to `score: 6/6 must-haves verified`
   - Remove the `gaps:` block from frontmatter (gap was resolved)
   - Add `resolved_by: "Phase 30 (tech debt closure — ROADMAP checkbox confirmed [x])"` field

2. In the Observable Truths table (Truth #6):
   - Change `PARTIAL` to `✓ VERIFIED`
   - Update evidence to note the gap is resolved: `77/77 SUMMARY.md files have the field. ROADMAP.md checkbox for 28-01-PLAN.md is now [x]. pre-push-docs-check.cjs passes.`

3. Update body status from `**Status:** gaps_found` to `**Status:** passed (gap resolved)`

4. In the Key Link Verification table, update the ROADMAP checkbox row from `NOT WIRED` to `✓ WIRED` with updated details.

5. In the Gaps Summary section, add resolution note:
   > **Resolved (Phase 30):** ROADMAP.md 28-01-PLAN.md checkbox is now [x]. pre-push-docs-check.cjs exits 0.

**Phase 29 VERIFICATION.md:**
1. In frontmatter:
   - Change `status: gaps_found` to `status: passed`
   - Change `score: 8/9 must-haves verified` to `score: 9/9 must-haves verified`
   - Remove the `gaps:` block from frontmatter (gap was resolved)
   - Add `resolved_by: "Phase 30 (tech debt closure — traceability table updated to Satisfied)"` field

2. In the Observable Truths table (Truth #9):
   - Change `FAILED` to `✓ VERIFIED`
   - Update evidence to: `All 6 INIT-EX-* rows in REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table now show 'Satisfied'`

3. Update body status from `**Status:** gaps_found` to `**Status:** passed (gap resolved)`

4. In the Required Artifacts table, update the REQUIREMENTS.md row from `FAILED` to `✓ VERIFIED`.

5. In the Gaps Summary section, add resolution note:
   > **Resolved (Phase 30):** REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table shows Satisfied for all 6 INIT-EX-* requirements.

<success_criteria>
- All three VERIFICATION.md files have `status: passed` in frontmatter
- Score fields updated to reflect full verification
- Resolution notes added explaining when/how gaps were closed
- Gap frontmatter blocks removed from phases 28 and 29
