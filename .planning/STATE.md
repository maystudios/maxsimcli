## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v2.0]: Claude Code is sole supported runtime — all other adapters to be removed
- [v2.0]: Three equal pillars: planning, context engineering, superior execution
- [v2.0]: 10 native skills (TDD, Debugging, Verification, Code Review, Simplify, Batch, SDD, Writing Plans, Brainstorming, Roadmap-Writing)
- [v2.0]: All skills deeply MAXSIM-integrated from day one (STATE.md, phases, artefakte)
- [v2.0]: Skills as native .claude/skills/ format — Claude Code auto-discovers and triggers them
- [v2.0]: Task-based context loading — agents load only task-relevant files
- [v2.0]: Target audience: all Claude Code users (Plug & Play)
- [v2.0]: v2.0 big bang release — all 10 phases complete before release
- [v2.0]: Dashboard important but comes after core skills and discussion system
- [v2.0]: 4 discussion flows confirmed (New Project, Init Existing, Feature/Phase, Todo/Bug)
- [v2.0]: Discussion system comes AFTER skills (skills infra needed first)
- [v2.0]: Reliability as dedicated phase (not distributed)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 must document adapter architecture before deletion — no recovery otherwise
- MCP server currently not functioning reliably — needs rebuild for dashboard communication (Phase 9)
- Skills folder misplaced at `.claude/agents/skills/` — fix in Phase 2
