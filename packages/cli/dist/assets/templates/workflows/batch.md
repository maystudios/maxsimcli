<sanity_check>
Before executing any step in this workflow, verify:
1. The current directory contains a `.planning/` folder — if not, stop and tell the user to run `/maxsim:new-project` first.
2. Git is initialized (`git rev-parse --git-dir` succeeds) — worktrees require a git repository.
3. `.planning/ROADMAP.md` exists — if not, stop and tell the user to initialize the project.
</sanity_check>

<purpose>
Decompose a large task into independent units, execute each in an isolated git worktree, and produce one PR per unit. Each unit gets its own branch, worktree, and PR — enabling parallel implementation with zero merge conflicts.

Follows the batch-worktree skill process: Research (decompose) -> Plan (validate independence) -> Spawn (worktree agents) -> Track (progress and failures).

<step name="initialize" priority="first">
Load context in one call:

```bash
INIT=$(node ~/.claude/maxsim/bin/maxsim-tools.cjs init quick "$DESCRIPTION")

Parse JSON for: `planner_model`, `executor_model`, `slug`, `date`, `timestamp`, `roadmap_exists`, `planning_exists`.

**If `roadmap_exists` is false:** Error — Batch mode requires an active project with ROADMAP.md. Run `/maxsim:new-project` first.

Verify git is available:
```bash
git rev-parse --git-dir > /dev/null 2>&1 || echo "ERROR: Not a git repository"
```

Store `BASE_BRANCH`:
```bash
BASE_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

- Each unit MUST be independently mergeable (hard gate from batch-worktree skill)
- If fewer than 3 units are identified, STOP and recommend /maxsim:quick instead

After planner returns:
1. Verify decomposition exists at `.planning/batch/${slug}/DECOMPOSITION.md`
2. Extract unit count
3. If unit count < 3: warn user and suggest `/maxsim:quick` instead. Ask: "Continue with batch (${unit_count} units) or switch to quick mode?"
4. Report: "Decomposition complete: ${unit_count} units identified"

If decomposition not found, error: "Planner failed to create DECOMPOSITION.md"

<step name="validate_independence">
Read the DECOMPOSITION.md and validate file independence across all units.

For each pair of units:
1. Extract the files owned by each unit
2. Compute the intersection
3. If any file appears in more than one unit, the validation fails

**If validation fails:**

Report the overlapping files and which units conflict:
```
## Independence Validation Failed

| File | Unit A | Unit B |

<failure_handling>
- **classifyHandoffIfNeeded false failure:** Agent reports "failed" with `classifyHandoffIfNeeded is not defined` error — Claude Code bug, not MAXSIM. Check if branch exists and has commits. If so, treat as success.
- **Independence validation fails twice:** Stop, present overlaps to user, ask for manual decomposition guidance.
- **Agent fails to create PR:** Check if `gh` CLI is authenticated. If not, report branch name for manual PR creation.
- **All agents fail:** Likely systemic issue (git config, permissions). Stop and report for investigation.
- **Fewer than 3 units identified:** Suggest `/maxsim:quick` instead. Do not force worktree overhead for small tasks.
