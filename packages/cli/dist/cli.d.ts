/**
 * MAXSIM Tools — CLI utility for MAXSIM workflow operations
 *
 * Replaces repetitive inline bash patterns across ~50 MAXSIM command/workflow/agent files.
 * Centralizes: config parsing, model resolution, phase lookup, git commits, summary verification.
 *
 * Usage: node maxsim-tools.cjs <command> [args] [--raw]
 *
 * This is a direct TypeScript port of maxsim/bin/maxsim-tools.cjs.
 * All imports resolve through @maxsim/core barrel export.
